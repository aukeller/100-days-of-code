# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 10, 2021 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Decided to brush up on some JS skills. Need to adjust a little bit after going at it with Flask/Python. Currently doing freeCodeCamp's JS Basics section. 

**Thoughts:** Once I finish this I'm going to continue w/ the odin project's JS path as I think it'll lead me in a solid direction.
