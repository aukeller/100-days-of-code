# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 10, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Decided to brush up on some JS skills. Need to adjust a little bit after going at it with Flask/Python. Currently doing freeCodeCamp's JS Basics section. 

**Thoughts:** Once I finish this I'm going to continue w/ the odin project's JS path as I think it'll lead me in a solid direction.

### Day 1: February 11, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp's JS Basics, definitely helped catch me up to speed. Started reading up more on objects and object constructors!

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to learn more about objects and OOP with JS

### Day 0: February 16, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Starting over wasn't due to laziness, just forgetfulness of logging. Just started learning the very basics of factory functions and modules, as well as closure and scope. Also began a tic-tac-toe project.

**Thoughts:** Moving into this new territory is a bit intimidating, but I'm sure it will click after practice.
